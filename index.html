        <p>Hi, I’m Danny O. Brenio, a developer who genuinely loves backend development.
I enjoy solving problems that most users never see—database logic, server-side architecture, system behavior, and performance optimization. I’m especially interested in how software works at a deeper level, from operating systems to backend frameworks and server configuration.
I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and improving my skills by building real projects and breaking things until I understand them.
<h4>What drives me:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Writing clean and logical backend code</li>
    <li>Understanding how systems work under the hood</li>
    <li>Turning ideas into functional, working systems</li>
</ul>   

        </p>

          <section class="project-section"><h1>Projects</h1></section> 
          <section class="collaborate-section"><h1>Work With Me</h1>
        
        <p>
        I enjoy working on projects where backend logic, system design, and problem-solving matter.
        If you’re looking for someone who cares about how things work behind the scenes, I’d love to collaborate. I focus on writing clean, maintainable backend code and building systems that are reliable, efficient, and easy to extend.
        </p>
