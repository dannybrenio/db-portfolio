                            Hi, I’m Danny O. Brenio, a developer who genuinely loves backend development.
                            I enjoy solving problems that most users never see—database logic, server-side architecture, system behavior, and performance optimization. I’m especially interested in how software works at a deeper level, from operating systems to backend frameworks and server configuration.
                            I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and improving my skills by building real projects and breaking things until I understand them.

                    I enjoy working on projects where backend logic, system design, and problem-solving matter.
                    If you’re looking for someone who cares about how things work behind the scenes, I’d love to collaborate. I focus on writing clean, maintainable backend code and building systems that are reliable, efficient, and easy to extend.
